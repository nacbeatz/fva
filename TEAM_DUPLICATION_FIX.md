# Team Member Duplication Fix

## Problem Analysis

The team member duplication issue was caused by several factors:

1. **Static Data Fallback**: The `Team.tsx` component had static team members that were used as fallback when Firebase data wasn't available
2. **Database Seeding**: The `DataContext` automatically seeded the database with static team members if the database was empty
3. **No Duplicate Prevention**: The Firebase service didn't check for existing team members before adding new ones
4. **Fallback Logic**: The Team component showed both Firebase and static data in some scenarios

## Root Causes

1. **Multiple Data Sources**: Team members existed both as static data in `Team.tsx` and in Firebase
2. **Seeding Logic**: Every time the app loaded with an empty database, it would re-seed with static data
3. **No Uniqueness Checks**: No validation to prevent adding team members with the same name
4. **Inconsistent Data Handling**: The component logic could show static data even when Firebase data existed

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Firebase Service (`src/services/firebaseService.ts`)

- **Added duplicate prevention in `addTeamMember`**: Now checks for existing team members with the same name before adding
- **Improved seeding logic in `initializeFirestore`**: Prevents duplicate seeding by tracking added names during initialization

### 2. Updated DataContext (`src/contexts/DataContext.tsx`)

- **Separated initialization logic**: Split data fetching from seeding to prevent race conditions
- **Better seeding conditions**: Only seeds when both team members and events are empty
- **Improved dependency tracking**: Uses proper useEffect dependencies to prevent unnecessary re-seeding

### 3. Fixed Team Component (`src/components/Team.tsx`)

- **Removed static data fallback**: Now only uses Firebase data to prevent showing duplicates
- **Added empty state handling**: Shows appropriate message when no team members are found
- **Simplified loading logic**: Cleaner loading state management

### 4. Added Admin Tools (`src/components/admin/TeamManagement.tsx`)

- **Cleanup button**: Added a "Clean Duplicates" button for admins to remove existing duplicates
- **Integration with cleanup utility**: Uses the existing `cleanupDuplicateData` function

### 5. Created Utility Functions

- **`src/utils/runCleanup.ts`**: Script to run cleanup operations
- **`src/utils/testDuplicatePrevention.ts`**: Test function to verify duplicate prevention works

## Key Changes Summary

### Firebase Service Changes
```typescript
// Before: No duplicate checking
export const addTeamMember = async (member: Omit<TeamMember, 'id'>) => {
    const teamRef = collection(db, 'team');
    const docRef = await addDoc(teamRef, { ...member, ... });
    return { id: docRef.id, ...member };
};

// After: Duplicate prevention
export const addTeamMember = async (member: Omit<TeamMember, 'id'>) => {
    // Check for existing team member with the same name
    const existingMembers = await getDocs(teamRef);
    const duplicateExists = existingMembers.docs.some(doc => {
        const data = doc.data();
        return data.name?.toLowerCase().trim() === member.name?.toLowerCase().trim();
    });
    
    if (duplicateExists) {
        throw new Error(`Team member with name "${member.name}" already exists`);
    }
    // ... rest of the function
};
```

### Team Component Changes
```typescript
// Before: Fallback to static data
const currentTeamMembers = firebaseTeamMembers && firebaseTeamMembers.length > 0 ? firebaseTeamMembers : teamMembers

// After: Only use Firebase data
const currentTeamMembers = firebaseTeamMembers || []
```

### DataContext Changes
```typescript
// Before: Single useEffect with complex logic
useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch data and seed in same effect
}, []);

// After: Separated concerns
useEffect(() => {
    // Only fetch data
}, []);

useEffect(() => {
    // Handle seeding separately with proper dependencies
}, [loading, teamMembers.length, events.length]);
```

## How to Use

### For Admins
1. Go to the admin panel
2. Navigate to Team Management
3. Click "Clean Duplicates" button to remove any existing duplicates
4. The system will now prevent new duplicates from being added

### For Developers
1. The system now automatically prevents duplicate team members
2. Use the test function to verify: `window.testDuplicatePrevention()`
3. Run cleanup manually: `window.runCleanupScript()`

## Prevention Measures

1. **Name-based uniqueness**: Team members are now unique by name (case-insensitive)
2. **Validation on add**: All new team member additions are validated
3. **Seeding protection**: Database seeding prevents duplicates during initialization
4. **Admin tools**: Easy cleanup tools for managing existing data

## Testing

Run the test function in browser console:
```javascript
// Test duplicate prevention
window.testDuplicatePrevention()

// Run cleanup
window.runCleanupScript()
```

## Future Improvements

1. Consider using email or ID-based uniqueness instead of name
2. Add bulk import validation
3. Implement soft deletes for better data management
4. Add audit logging for team member changes
