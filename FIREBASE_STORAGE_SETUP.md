## ðŸ”¥ **Firebase Storage Setup Guide**

### **Current Situation:**
Your Firebase project is on the **Spark (free) plan**, but Firebase Storage requires the **Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan**.

### **Option 1: Upgrade to Blaze Plan (Recommended)**

**Steps:**
1. **Click "Upgrade project"** button in your Firebase console
2. **Choose Blaze plan** (pay-as-you-go)
3. **Add payment method** (credit card required)

**Cost:** Essentially free for small projects!
- **Storage**: 5GB free/month
- **Downloads**: 1GB free/day  
- **Operations**: 50,000 free/day

Your small team website will likely stay within free limits.

### **Option 2: Use Without File Upload**

If you prefer not to upgrade:

1. **Don't select files** - just leave file input empty
2. **Use image URLs** instead:
   - Find images online
   - Right-click â†’ "Copy image address"
   - Paste the URL in "Image URL" field
3. **Or leave empty** - automatic placeholder images will be used

### **Quick Image URL Sources:**
- **Unsplash**: https://unsplash.com (free stock photos)
- **Pixabay**: https://pixabay.com (free images)
- **Your existing images**: Upload to any free service like Imgur

### **Recommendation:**
**Upgrade to Blaze plan** - it's essentially free for your use case and gives you full functionality!
